## Release of BIBCAT Publisher
BIBCAT Publisher is an open-source linked-data publishing platform 
for an institutionâ€™s knowledge graphs and digital objects. Using 
RML mappings, different data sources can feed into a normalized

[Schema.org](http://schema.org/), and [bibliotek-o](https://bibliotek-o.org/1.1/ontology.html) 
vocabularies.

Unique digital objects can be ingested into a Fedora repository with access
and discovery provided through a search index while also supporting 
a full SPARQL endpoint using Blazegraph. A full CRUD UI for the Knowledge
Graphs.
