title: Quickstart


In this section, you'll [install BIBCAT](/topic/install.html),
get a brief overview of the basic [bibcat](/topic/importing-bibcat.html)
functions. Next we will use the `pymarc` Python module to
parse some MARC21 records that we will then use the Library
of Congress [marc2bibframe2](/topic/marc2bibframe2.html) XSLT project 
to create a BIBFRAME 2.0 RDF Graph that we will then use in the 
subsequent sections.
